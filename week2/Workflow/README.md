# Week 2 VAPT Workflow

## Overview

This folder contains documentation and workflow details for the Week 2 Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) project conducted on the Metasploitable2 and DVWA lab environments. The objective was to identify, exploit, and document critical security vulnerabilities using advanced and manual techniques combined with automated scanning tools.

## Tasks Performed

- Setup and validated network connectivity between attacker (Kali Linux) and targets (Metasploitable2, DVWA).
- Executed multi-stage exploitation chains using Metasploit Framework.
- Customized Exploit-DB Python Proof-of-Concept scripts tailored to lab environments.
- Conducted web application testing with OWASP ZAP and sqlmap to identify SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
- Exploited FTP backdoor vulnerability in vsftpd 2.3.4 via Metasploit.
- Collected evidence using Meterpreter sessions and network traffic capture.
- Created network attack path diagrams using Draw.io to visualize exploit flows.
- Drafted detailed penetration testing reports, executive summaries, and stakeholder communication briefs.

## Tools Used

Metasploit, OWASP ZAP, sqlmap, Nmap, Wireshark, Draw.io

## Folder Structure
